# Demonstration of a React and AnimXYZ API

[AnimXYZ](https://animxyz.com/) hails itself as the "first composable CSS animation toolkit." It promises the availability of a "nearly limitless number of unique animations without writing a single keuframe."

Well, I don't know about all that...yet. But after following [this tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/animate-react-app-animxyz/) and doing some playing around with it, I have to say I like it.

The animation styling is straightforward, consistent and fairly minimal as compared to CSS animation. I encourage folks to try it out. Have fun!
